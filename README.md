Welcome to the Java Tutorial Codes repository! This repository is structured to help you learn Core Java, from the basics to advanced topics. Below is the learning structure and what you can expect to find in each section.

## Learning Structure

### Basic ðŸŸ¢
1. **Syntax and Structure**: Understanding the basic syntax and structure of Java programs.
2. **Data Types and Variables**: Learning about primitive data types and how to declare and use variables.
3. **Operators**: Using arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.
4. **Control Flow Statements**: Implementing conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
5. **Arrays**: Declaring, initializing, and processing arrays.
6. **Methods**: Understanding method declaration, parameters, return types, and method calls.

### Intermediate ðŸŸ¡
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2. **Exception Handling**: Learning how to handle errors and exceptions using try, catch, and finally blocks.
3. **Collections Framework**: Using data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, etc.
4. **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
5. **Multithreading**: Basics of creating and managing threads.

### Advanced ðŸ”´
1. **Networking**: Understanding sockets, server-client architecture, and network communication.
2. **Database Connectivity**: Using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with databases.
3. **Advanced Multithreading**: Concepts like synchronization, inter-thread communication, and thread pools.
4. **JavaFX and Swing**: Creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
5. **Frameworks**: Introduction to popular frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
